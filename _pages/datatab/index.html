Growth Leasing has a unique relationship with a data services provider that makes us highly competitive in the cannabis market. Through our collaboration with the data provider, we have unique insights and user id's for more than 6 million cannabis store
visitors nationwide including more than a quarter million user id's in Washington. This enables us to present online advertising to a highly targeted segment with virtually no waste. This data fuels our sales cycle, as our sale force can present prospects with their own store
traffic, contrast it with their competitors' traffic and detail why carrying our products can improve that number. Our relationship with our data partner, Refinition, is proprietary and exclusive to Growth Leasing. While the detail behind this dataset is complex, below is an
overview of how Growth Leasing uses the data to accelerate sales. </p>
