<p>The licensed entities are embarking on a 3-channel strategy to maximize the monetization of the
entire soil-to-oil value chain:</p>
<ul class="bulleted">
  <li>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Branded - Extracts and distillates in multiple consumer product lines
</li>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Label - bulk oil supply to large regional/national brands
  </li>
  <li>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Edibles - base oils to companies focused on creating edibles
  </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

<p> The market pricing for extracted oils and concentrates remains strong both in demand and price while
the market for cannabis flower continues to be commodotized. We have established a strong set of product
offerings to take advantage of these economic factors. In addition to the array of branded cannabis
extraction products, we have identified considerable opportunity in the burgeoning wholesale markets and
the licensed entities will be offering a base cannabis oil to be used in the production of edibles and
cannabis vapor products.</p>

<p>The product development process has yielded an initial slate of three consumer brands designed specifically
to penetrate high-growth segments of the cannabis market. Market research, brand definition, materials
development and prototyping are all complete. The first brand targeted to launch in Q3, 2018 is  CLOAK – a
confidential cannabis product, designed for discretion and targeted at men and women over 45 who have been
to a dispensary more than five times. The second consumer brand in Q3, 2018, is COMPOSED, a blended
cannabis oil with a diminished impact and targeted at users who have been to a dispensary less than four times.</p>

<p>CULT, our concentrates brand, is out of development and prototyping and slated to launch in early Q4, 2018. It
is a wax-like concentrate targeted to heavy users under 35. CULT will be introduced with the CULT Bombilla,
a custom-designed piece of hardware that will extend and expand the market for these types of concentrates. The CULT
Bombilla enables wax concentrate use on-the-go, without any of the torches, glass, tools, mess and stink usually
associated with “dabbing.” In early Q1, 2019, we are targeting the launch of Cabinet, a curative and palliative
concentrate designed to address common ailments such as insomnia, nausea, and chronic pain.</p>

<p>In the images below, you will see a sample of the various products being prepared for launch and a first
look at the online assets we will be using to build brand awareness, market  create demand and drive inventory turnover.</p>

<h3>Product Website Links</h3>
