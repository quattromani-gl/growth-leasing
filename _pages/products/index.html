<p>With market pricing for extracted oils and concentrates remaining strong in demand and price while the market for canna flower continues its commoditization, we have established a strong set of product offers to take advantage of these economic factors. In addition to our branded cannabis extraction array of products, the company will be entering these 2 very interesting and growing wholesale markets. We will be offering a base cannabis oil to be used in the production of edibles and canna vapor products.</p>

<p>We are embarking on a 3 channel strategy to maximize the monetization of everything we grow into oil;</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
  <li>
    Branded-CO2 BHO extracts and distillates in 3 product lines
  </li>
  <li>
    Private Label-bulk oil supply to large regional/national brands
  </li>
  <li>
    Food Service-base oils to companies focused on creating edibles
  </li>
</ul>
