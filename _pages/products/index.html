<p> The market pricing for extracted oils and concentrates remains strong both in demand and price while 
the market for cannabis flower continues to be commodotized. The licensed entities have established a strong
set of product offerings to take advantage of these economic factors.

The product development process has yielded an initial slate of three consumer brands designed specifically 
to penetrate underserved portions of the cannabis market. Market research, brand definition, materials 
development and prototyping are all complete. The first two brands are targeted to launch in QI, 2018 are 
CLOAK – a confidential cannabis product, designed for discretion and targeted at men and women over 45 who 
have been to a dispensary more than 5 times. The second consumer brand, composed, is a blended cannabis oil
with a diminished impact and targeted at older users who have been to a dispensary less than four times.

CULT, our concentrates brand is us of development and prototyping and slated to launch in early QI, 2018. It 
is a wax-like concentrate that is targeted to heavy users under 35. CULT will be introduced with the CULT Bombilla,
a custom-designed piece of hardware that will extend and expand the market for these types of concentrates. 
The CULT Bombilla enables wax concentrate use on-the-go, without any of the torches, glass, tools, mess and stink 
usually associated with “dabbing.” In early Q1, 2019 we are targeting the launch of Cabinet, a curative 
and palliative concentrate designed toz address common ailments of the middle-age and senior sector.

In the images below, you will a sampling of the various products being prepared for launch and a first 
look at the online advertising we will be using to create demand and drive inventory turnover.

In addition to the branded cannabis extraction array of products, we have identified considerable opportunity in the growing
wholesale markets, and the licensed entities will be offering a base cannabis oil to be used in the production
of edibles and canna vapor products.</p>

<p>The licensed entities are embarking on a 3-channel strategy to maximize the monetization of the 
entiore soil-to-poil value chain.</p>
