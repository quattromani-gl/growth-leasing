<p>With market pricing for extracted oils and concentrates remaining strong in demand and price while the
market for canna flower continues its commoditization, the licensed entities have established a strong
set of product offerings to take advantage of these economic factors. In addition to the branded
cannabis extraction array of products, we feel that there is considerable opportunity in the growing
wholesale markets. The licensed entities will be offering a base cannabis oil to be used in the production
of edibles and canna vapor products.</p>

<p>The licensed entities are embarking on a 3-channel strategy to maximize the monetization of everything
that is grown into oil;</p>
