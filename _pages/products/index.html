<p>The licensed entities are embarking on a 3-channel strategy to maximize the monetization of the 
entire soil-to-oil value chain.</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
  <li>
Branded - Extracts and distillates in multiple consumer product lines
</li>
<li>
Private Label - bulk oil supply to large regional/national brands
  </li>
  <li>
Food Service-base oils to companies focused on creating edibles
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The market pricing for extracted oils and concentrates remains strong both in demand and price while 
the market for cannabis flower continues to be commodotized. The licensed entities have established a strong
set of product offerings to take advantage of these economic factors. In addition to the array of branded cannabis 
extraction products, we have identified considerable opportunity in the burgeoning wholesale markets, and 
the licensed entities will be offering a base cannabis oil to be used in the production of edibles and 
cannabis vapor products.</p>

<p>The product development process has yielded an initial slate of three consumer brands designed specifically 
to penetrate underserved portions of the cannabis market. Market research, brand definition, materials 
development and prototyping are all complete. The first brandtargeted to launch in QI, 2018 is  
CLOAK – a confidential cannabis product, designed for discretion and targeted at men and women over 45 who 
have been to a dispensary more than 5 times. The second consumer brand, composed, is a blended cannabis oil
with a diminished impact and targeted at older users who have been to a dispensary less than four times.</p>

<p>CULT, our concentrates brand, is out of development and prototyping and slated to launch in early Q1, 2019. It 
is a wax-like concentrate targeted to heavy users under 35. CULT will be introduced with the CULT Bombilla,
a custom-designed piece of hardware that will extend and expand the market for these types of concentrates. The CULT
Bombilla enables wax concentrate use on-the-go, without any of the torches, glass, tools, mess and stink usually
associated with “dabbing.” In early Q1, 2019 we are targeting the launch of Cabinet, a curative and palliative
concentrate designed toz address common ailments of the middle-age and senior sector.</p>

<p>In the images below, you will a sampling of the various products being prepared for launch and a first 
look at the online advertising we will be using to create demand and drive inventory turnover.</p>
