<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>We concluded a successful ’17 grow season at our Grandview facility and we now have over 7,000 pounds of cleaned, cured, and now frozen, cannabis This positions us with an ample supply of raw product to successfully enter the market and generate revenue in ’18. Our experience in 2017 has taught us a considerable amount that should translate to increasing our efficiencies for the 2018 season in WA and future grow operations in other states. We completed and successfully utilized over 116,000 square feet of facilities with extensive implementation of industry leading automation. Our view is that raw cannabis prices will continue to decline and therefore the key to maintaining our profit margins is being at the forefront of efficient growing.</p>
