<p>Our Grandview, WA facility is fully operational and we are well underway with the 2018 growing season.
We have concluded a successful 2017 grow season at our Grandview facility and there is now overWe are beginning
to process our flash frozen 2017 crop of 7,000 pounds of cleaned and cured cannabis safely in storage. 
This positions the licensed entities with an ample supply of raw product to successfully enter the market 
and generate revenue in 2018. Our experience in 2017 has taught us a considerable amount that should 
translate to increasing our efficiencies for the 2018 season in WA and future grow operations in other states. 
We completed and successfully utilized over 116,000 square feet of facilities with extensive implementation 
of industry leading automation. Our view is that raw cannabis prices will continue to decline and 
therefore the key to maintaining profit margins is being at the forefront of efficient growing.</p>
