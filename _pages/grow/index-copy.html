<p>Our Grandview, WA facility is fully operational, and we are well underway with the 2018 growing season.
The licensed entities are now producing concentrate from the flash frozen 2017 inventory of 7,000 pounds of cleaned
and cured cannabis that was in cryostorage. This provides the licensed entities an ample supply of high-quality
raw product to successfully execute the 2018 market launch and achieve revenue generation targets.</p>
<p>
The cultivation experience in 2017 has been particularly instructive and is already increasing efficiencies
for the 2018 season in Washington. Cultivation methodologies are now optimized, yielding reductions in personnel, 
optimizing our nutrient effectiveness and reducing pesticide use while maintaining plant health and yield. This 
sets a solid foundation for future grow operations in other states. We maintain our view that raw cannabis prices 
will continue to decline and the key to maintaining profit margins is continual innovation in efficient growing.
