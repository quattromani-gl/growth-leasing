<p>Our Grandview, WA facility is fully operational and we are well underway with the 2018 growing season.
Our successful 2017 season yielded 7,000 pounds of cleaned and cured cannabis safely in flash frozen storage. 
This positions the licensed entities with an ample supply of raw product to successfully enter the market 
and generate revenue in 2018. Our experience in 2017 has taught us a considerable amount, increasing our
efficiencies during the 2018 season and laying a solid foundation for future grow operations in other states. 
We completed and successfully utilized more than 116,000 square feet of facilities with extensive  
implementation of industry leading automation. Our view is that raw cannabis prices will continue to decline
and therefore the key to maintaining profit margins is being at the forefront of efficient growing.</p>
