<p>Our Grandview, WA facility is fully operational, and we are well underway with the 2018 growing season. 
We are now producing concentrate from our flash frozen 2017 crop of 7,000 pounds of cleaned and cured cannabis
that has been in cryostorage. This provides the licensed entities an ample supply of high-quality raw product
to successfully execute our 2018 market launch and achieve our revenue generation targets. Our experience in
2017 has taught us a considerable amount that is already increasing our efficiencies for the 2018 season in 
Washington. We have optimized our cultivation methodologies and significantly reduced our pesticide use while 
maintaining plant health and yield, which sets a solid foundation for future grow operations in other states. 
We maintain our view that raw cannabis prices will continue to decline; the key to maintaining profit margins 
is continual innovation in efficient growing.</p>
