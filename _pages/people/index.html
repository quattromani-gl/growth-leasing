<p>We have put together a great team of professionals to carry out our mission consisting of 16 managers
in a wide array of fields of expertise, and we have been very pleased with the rest of our staffing efforts
to fill out our workforce.</p>

<p>Continuing our push to integrate the best talent in the market, we have hired Brent Toepper as the
industry’s first Chief Cannabis Officer. Brent will take the lead on genetic selection, product
development, and marketing. As one of the industry extraction pioneers, his “soil to oil” vision becomes
a reality as a part of our team. We are in the process of acquiring all of Brent’s assets and IP as a part of his joining our team. We anticipate that Brent’s extensive experience and network in California will
allow for a quick and successful entry into that market.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Q3 in 2017, we added Gary Ross to the team. With more than 30 years’ experience
in the high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry and device production, Gary
has expertise in all aspects of technology. Throughout his career, he has held multiple management
roles at National Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor. Gary was also the CEO of OpenVAPE and played a major role within that company as it became one of the largest and most successful vape manufacturers in the country. Gary brings a wealth of knowledge to the table and has already played a key role in identifying and evaluating new business opportunities.</p>

<p>At the same time, David Ross also joined the Growth Leasing team. David previously worked for a
startup specializing in the distribution of vape products. He later joined OpenVAPE as a Product
Development Manager, where he managed the design and development of several different products.
He is well versed in the cannabis industry and will play an important role in Growth Leasing’s product
development efforts.</p>

<p>Through Brent, we have also gained access to several members of his team to fill key roles within our
organization. Chris Larsen and Eric Levitt have both joined the Growth Leasing team within the past
several weeks. Chris has extensive specialized expertise in construction and has managed the buildout of
several cannabis facilities in the past; he will oversee all future construction of Growth Leasing facilities. Eric Levitt has many years of experience in the cannabis space, specifically in wholesale customer relations and sales, and will play a large role in both our sales and business development teams.</p>

<p>Once product is ready for market, marketing will be led by Tyler Babushkin. Tyler has worked with an ad agency in New York City before moving to Washington to start an agency servicing the Cannabis Industry. Tyler is a veteran in cannabis marketing and distribution and has held marketing positions with multiple companies in Washington over the past several years.</p>
