<h2>Martin Levion - CEO</h2>

<p>Martin’s extensive experience on Wall Street positions him well to be the company’s Chief Executive. His career at Salomon Bros, Lehman Brothers and Societe General focused on the arbitrage of capital markets leveraging a wealth of knowledge regarding regulations, taxation and structure. Martin has been an investor and board member of numerous early-stage companies.
</p>

<p>We have put together a great team of professionals to carry out our mission consisting of 16 managers
in a wide array of fields of expertise, and we have been very pleased with the rest of our staffing efforts
to fill out our workforce.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Q3 in 2017, we added Gary Ross to the team. With more than 30 years’ experience
in the high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry and device production, Gary
has expertise in all aspects of technology. Throughout his career, he has held multiple management
roles at National Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor. Gary was also the CEO of OpenVAPE and played a major role within that company as it became one of the largest and most successful vape manufacturers in the country. Gary brings a wealth of knowledge to the table and has already played a key role in identifying and evaluating new business opportunities.</p>

<p>At the same time, David Ross also joined the Growth Leasing team. David previously worked for a
startup specializing in the distribution of vape products. He later joined OpenVAPE as a Product
Development Manager, where he managed the design and development of several different products.
He is well versed in the cannabis industry and will play an important role in Growth Leasing’s product
development efforts.</p>

<p>Over the past several months, Chris Larsen has taken a lead role in the construction and completion of all Growth Leasing facilities in Grandview, WA. Chris has extensive specialized expertise in construction and has managed the buildout of several cannabis facilities in the past; he will oversee all future construction of Growth Leasing facilities. </p>

<p>Once product is ready for market, marketing will be led by Tyler Babushkin. Tyler worked with an ad agency in New York City before moving to Washington to start an agency servicing the Cannabis Industry. Tyler is a veteran in cannabis marketing and distribution and has held marketing positions with multiple companies in Washington over the past several years.</p>

<p> As we move towards a busy 2018 season we have appointed Gabe Coleman as the General Manager of all Growth Leasing facilities in Grandview, Washington. He will oversee all future projects and updates to the facilities and will work closely with Chris Larsen to manage the construction of the extraction facility. Gabe has many years of experience in the wine industry and has held management positions with several wineries across California, most recently with Caymus Vineyards. Gabe’s agricultural, management, and leadership skills make him a valuable addition to the team who will undoubtedly help drive the successful completion of projects.</p>
