<p>We have put together a great team of professionals to carry out our mission consisting of 16
managers in a wide array of fields of expertise, and we have been very pleased with the rest of
our staffing efforts to fill out our workforce.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Q3 in 2017, we added Gary Ross to the team. With more than 30 years’
experience in the high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry and device
production, Gary has expertise in all aspects of technology business. Throughout his career, he
has held multiple management roles at National Semiconductor and Fairchild Semiconductor.
Gary was also a founder and CEO at OpenVAPE and played a major role within that company
as it became one of the largest and most successful vape manufacturers in the country. Gary
brings a wealth of knowledge to the table and has already played a key role in identifying and
evaluating new business opportunities.</p>

<p>At the same time, David Ross also joined the Growth Leasing team. David previously worked for
a startup specializing in the distribution of vape products. He later joined OpenVAPE as a
Product Development Manager, where he managed the design and development of several
different products. He is well versed in the cannabis industry and will play an important role in
Growth Leasing’s product development efforts.</p>

<p>Continuing our push to integrate the best talent in the market, we have hired Brent Toepper as
the industry’s first Chief Cannabis Officer. Brent will take the lead in our genetic selection,
product development, and marketing. As one of the industry extraction pioneers, his “soil to oil”
vision becomes a reality as a part of our team. We are in the process of acquiring all of Brent’s
assets and IP as a part of his joining our team.</p>

<p>Through Brent, we have also gained access to several members of his team to fill key roles
within our organization. Chris Larsen and Eric Levitt have both joined the Growth Leasing team
within the past several weeks. Chris has extensive specialized expertise in construction and has
managed the buildout of several cannabis facilities in the past; he will oversee all future
construction of Growth Leasing facilities. Eric Levitt has many years of experience in the
cannabis space, specifically in wholesale customer relations and sales, and will play a large role
in both our sales and business development teams.</p>

<p>Once product is ready for market, sales will be led by Tyler Babushkin. Tyler is a veteran in
cannabis sales and has held sales and marketing positions with multiple companies in
Washington over the past several years. Over the next two months, we plan on hiring several
new individuals, based out of the Tumwater distribution facility to fill sales and fulfillment roles.</p>
