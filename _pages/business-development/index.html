2018 has been our most productive year, with a sharp uptick in both opportunity and engagement in the third quarter. 
The licensed entities are entering the final startup phase in Washington, with consumer products hitting the shelves 
before the end of the quarter. We have refined our processes and SOPs, learning from our WA experience, and are 
expanding our footprint and capabilities into multiple states. The company is presently evaluating expansion opportunities
in Massachusetts and California, as we become operational in Washington and Colorado. These opportunities are closely
aligned with our core strategy and will focus on extraction of cannabis oil and the production of multiple, branded 
cannabis oils and concentrates. We are continually monitoring both the federal and state-by-state regulatory 
environment as another consideration as we pursue our national expansion.

In Washington, good progress has also been made on the development of a sales and distribution center in Tumwater, WA.
This site provides a significant presence in Western Washington and will be a hub for Pacific Coast distribution, where
85% of Washington cannabis consumers reside. The Tumwater facility has been fully permitted and construction has begun,
with an operational target of October 31st. Once operational, the Tumwater facility will enable the licensed entities 
to fortify and expand their retailer relationships more efficiently, increasing margins.

We are confident that Growth Leasing will be able to develop a licensed presence in Colorado, the 2nd largest cannabis
market in the country, by the end of Q1, 2019. The licensing process is well underway, and we are exploring opportunities
to accelerate this schedule. The Company is under contract for more than an acre of land in Ft. Collins, CO, 55 miles 
north of Denver. The land has already been zoned for cannabis production and we expect to be operational (pending licensing)
by Q2, 2019. This Ft. Collins site will be devoted to processing, storage and distribution. The regulatory landscape in
Colorado includes a rapidly maturing market, commoditization of cannabis flower and a lack of “Tied Rules,” as seen in 
Washington. In this environment, it is more efficient to purchase cannabis feedstock from various grow operations and focus 
on extraction activities. This will have a positive impact on margins and efficiency, and opens up the opportunity to 
arbitrage the feedstock purchases.
