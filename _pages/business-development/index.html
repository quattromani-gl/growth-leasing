<hr>

<p>An exceptionally busy time expanding our footprint and capabilities into multiple states, the company is currently evaluating opportunities with processing facilities in Colorado and California. These facilities will focus on extraction of cannabis oil and the production of a line branded cannabis oils and concentrates.</p>

<p>We are optimistic that Growth Leasing will be able to develop a presence in Colorado and California â€“ two of the largest cannabis markets in the country, by the end of 2018.</p>

<p>Good progress has also been made on the development of a sales and distribution center in Tumwater,
Washington, giving us a presence in Western Washington. This facility will be a hub for distribution
along the Pacific Coast, an area where 85% of consumers in the state reside. Once operational, this
facility will enable the licensed entities to service their relationships with retailers more efficiently. We expect to begin operations out of this facility in early Q3.</p>
