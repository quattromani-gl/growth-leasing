<p>We are in final Due Diligence to purchase a wholesale extraction company located in California. With existing licenses and large wholesale custom oil clients, the company is well positioned to be a top player in the largest cannabis market in the world. We are also completing due diligence for the purchase a California product and branding house.</p>

<p>We are also evaluating opportunities for expansion in a handful of other legal markets across the US. If all goes according to plan, we are hoping to have a presence in Oregon, Colorado, and California by the end of 2018. Oregon and Colorado have established markets that we would enter through an extraction operation, while California is the largest legal cannabis market in the country.</p>

<p>Good progress has also been made on the development of a sales and distribution center in Tumwater, Washington, giving us a presence in Western Washington. This facility will be a hub for distribution along the Pacific Coast, an area where 85% of consumers in the state reside. Once operational, this facility will enable us to service our relationships with retailers more efficiently. We expect to begin operations out of this facility in early Q2.</p>
