2018 is the culmination of a lot of collaborative effort, creative problem solving and intense focus. The third
quarter has seen a lot of milestones, including the Grandview, WA certificate of occupancy for extraction, the 
first concentrate production in the Washington facilities and the completion of brand development activities. 
The licensed entities are entering the final phases in Washington with consumer products hitting the shelves 
before the end of the quarter. We have refined our processes and SOPs, and with this experience,are expanding our 
footprint and capabilities into multiple states. The company is presently evaluating expansion opportunities
in Massachusetts and California, as we become operational in Washington and Colorado. These opportunities are closely
aligned with our core strategy and will focus on extraction of cannabis oil and the production of multiple, branded 
cannabis oils and concentrates. We are continually monitoring both the federal and state-by-state regulatory 
environment as we pursue our national expansion.

In Washington, good progress has also been made on the development of a sales and distribution center in Tumwater, WA.
This site provides a significant presence in Western Washington and will be a logistical hub for Pacific Coast distribution, 
where 85% of Washington cannabis consumers reside. The Tumwater facility has been fully permitted and construction
has begun, with an operational target of October 31st. Once operational, the Tumwater facility will enable the licensed 
entities to fortify and expand their retailer relationships more efficiently, increasing margins. </p>

We are well underway with the our Colorado expansion and are confident that our progress will prvide us a presence in
the 2nd largest cannabis market in the country by the end of Q1, 2019. The licensing process is well underway, and 
we are exploring opportunities to accelerate this schedule. The Company is also under contract for land in Ft. Collins, CO,
55 miles north of Denver. The land has already been zoned for cannabis production and we expect to be operational
(pending licensing) by Q2, 2019. This Ft. Collins site will be devoted to processing, storage and distribution. The 
regulatory landscape in Colorado includes a rapidly maturing market and commoditization of cannabis flower. In this 
environment, it is often more efficient to purchase cannabis feedstock from various grow operations and focus on 
extraction activities. This will have a positive impact on margins and efficiency, and opens up the opportunity to 
arbitrage the feedstock purchases. However, if we identify the right opportunity, we will construct a Colorado grow
operation focused primarily on those strains best suited for extraction.
