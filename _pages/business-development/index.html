<p>We're in final due diligence to bring online a wholesale extraction company located in California. With
existing licenses and large wholesale custom oil clients, the company is well positioned to be a top
player in the largest cannabis market in the world. We are also completing due diligence for the
purchase of a California product and branding house. This will advance our presence in California by at
least 18 months.</p>

<p>We are also evaluating opportunities for expansion in a handful of other legal markets across the US. If
all goes according to plan, we are hoping to have a presence in Oregon, Colorado, and California by the
end of 2018. Oregon and Colorado have established markets that we would enter through extraction
facilities, while California is the largest legal cannabis market in the country.</p>

<p>Good progress has also been made on the development of a sales and distribution center in Tumwater,
Washington, giving us a presence in Western Washington. This facility will be a hub for distribution
along the Pacific Coast, an area where 85% of consumers in the state reside. Once operational, this
facility will enable the licensed entities to service their relationships with retailers more efficiently. We expect to begin operations out of this facility in early Q2.</p>
