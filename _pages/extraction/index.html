<p>Our Washington State processing facility has been fully certified and is online. We recently received
our Certificate of Occupancy and have begun the extraction process in earnest. Combining the expertise of
our cultivation team to target the right combination of strains with the experience of our extraction team
to transmute these strains into a high impact concentrate oil that will appeal to our targets markets.
As youâ€™ll see in the images below, our Washington facility is state -of-the-art and was cited by the Washington 
State Inspector as one of the most professional facilities in the state. Our experience in the construction, 
certification and operation of a cannabis  processing facility, including harvesting, flash freezing, and 
cryostorage has yielded repeatable processes that will accelerate the extraction projects in other states. 
We completed the Washington facilities which includes Butane Hash Oil (BHO), Ethanol and Supercritical CO2
extraction, processing, packaging and cryostorage. To date, we have successfully utilized more
than 116,000 square feet of facilities with extensive implementation of industry leading automation.
