<p>Our Washington State processing facility has been fully certified and is online. We recently received 
our Certificate of Occupancy and have begun the extraction process in earnest. The completed Washington
facilities includes Butane Hash Oil (BHO), Ethanol and Supercritical CO2 extraction, processing, packaging
and cryostorage. To date, we have successfully developed and operationalized multi-disciplinary cannabis 
facilities with extensive implementation of industry leading automation. The extraction facilities and 
our grow operations combine the expertise of our cultivation team to target the right combination of 
strains with the experience of our extraction team to convert these strains into high impact concentrate oil.</p> 

<p>As youâ€™ll see in the images below, our Washington facility is state -of-the-art, and was cited by the Liquor and
Cannabis Board inspector as the most professional facility he has ever seen. Our experience in the construction, 
certification and operation of a cannabis processing facility, including harvesting, flash freezing, and 
cryostorage has yielded repeatable processes that will accelerate our efforts in other states.
