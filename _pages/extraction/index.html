<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>We have completed Phase One of our processing facility, which consisted of the harvesting process, flash freezing, and freezer storage units. This was the most time critical project we had as it had to be completed and operational by harvest time. Our harvest, as well as some purchased flower, is now safely awaiting extraction.</p>

<p>We are moving towards the completion of the facilities to house our BHO, ethanol and CO2 extraction labs and packaging facilities. With different building structures required for the different disciplines, we are moving quickly to complete BHO, built into container systems already on premise and anticipate that facility coming on line first.  In parallel, we are working on a more traditional building structure for packaging, ethanol and CO2. We anticipate both facilities coming on line early Q2.</p>
