<h3>Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department</h3>

<p>There has been significant discussion in the press about the decision by Jeff Sessions to rescind the Cole Memorandum that was issued in 2013 by the Obama Justice Department. The Cole Memorandum had
created a hands-off approach for the Justice Department regarding the enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that had passed their own legalized environment (currently 29 states plus the District of Columbia). Within the marijuana industry things have pretty much continued as normal since
the Sessions announcement. Our feeling is that the US Attorneys in legal states will not decide to
enforce federal marijuana laws against operations that are compliant with their respective state laws.
Since 2014, the Justice Department has been unable to do so because Congress has prohibited the
spending of funds in the Rohrabacher-Farr (now Rohrabacher-Blumenauer) amendment to the general
spending bill, which prohibits the Justice Department from spending funds to interfere with the
implementation of state medical cannabis laws. As the current Omnibus Spending Bill for 2018 is still
being debated, we do not know yet if the Rohrabacher – Blumenauer amendment will be included in the
2018 Budget. It was excluded from the House version of the bill because the House Committee declined
to include it; in spite of overwhelming support from both parties and, of course, public opinion. It has
been included in the Senate version of the spending bill, but the results of the reconciliation committee
and their negotiations with President Trump are still to be determined. As immigration and deficit spending have
dominated the discussion of the 2018 Omnibus Bill, we do not yet know the outcome of this debate.</p>

<p>Multiple marijuana legal-state elected officials have vocally and vigorously defended the Marijuana
Industry – with the most volume coming from the four states we are currently focused on: Washington,
California, Oregon, and Colorado. The Governors, Senators, and Congressmen from those states have all
rallied around the industry. Not only are they focused on the billions of dollars of tax revenues, and the
thousands of jobs created (more people are now employed in marijuana than in the coal industry), but
also on social benefits such as lower crime rates, lower incarceration rates, and lower juvenile
consumption rates. If a US Attorney in a legal state did decide to prosecute state-law abiding operations,
we feel that the government of that state would do everything it could to inhibit that prosecution and
would turn the situation into a state’s rights conflict with the federal government – assuring appeals up
to the Supreme Court. Given the time it would take for that process and the expected substantial anti-
Trump voter backlash in November, it is likely that the House, and potentially the Senate, could find
themselves with either a change in party majority or a significant shift in party leverage prior to the
litigation outcome.</p>

<p>We believe that the continued state of confusion is beneficial to us in that we continue to make progress at a rapid pace while many less sophisticated and less informed people are deterred from entering the industry. Of course, this is not without risk as we cannot guarantee the outcome will be as we predict, but we feel that we are in a good position.</p>
